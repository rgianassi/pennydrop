# Penny Drop

Beginner Penny Drop project to learn Android development.

## Rules

Penny Drop is a tabletop game for two or more players where the players take turns rolling
a single D6 (normal six-sided dice are called D6s).
The rules are as follows:

 * Player rolls a number, then puts a penny (a small coin) into the slot number that they just rolled.
 * If the slot is a 6, the penny falls through the board and is out of the game.
 * If the slot is already filled, the player takes all the pennies on the board and play passes on to the next player.
 * Players must roll at least once, but can then pass their turn to the next person.
 * The first player to get rid of all their pennies is the winner.
